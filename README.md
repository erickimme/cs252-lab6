Project Name: Vernacular
 
Description of Project:
Randomly generated field of characters. Players start with a row on either side of the field,
so that one player would "own" the top row and another would have the bottom row.
Game goes by turn and each turn a player strings together characters to form a valid English word.
The user's "territory" expands when he/she makes a word. The goal is to expand territory into the other
player's base line (through making valid words and expanding territory from there).

Technologies we will be using + services:
HTML5, CSS, Javascript
Firebase
Heroku
Cambridge/Merriam Webster dictionary API
Bootstrap, EaselJS
